CMPE 140
<b>Outcome</b>
+ 1. Demonstrate an overall understanding of computer systems: architecture, organization, metrics, and trends.
+ 2. Provide a detailed discussion on processor instruction-set architecture, microarchitecture, and memory hierarchy, and an
introduction to advanced topics such as instruction- and thread-level parallelism, and multicore/multiprocessor systems.
+ 3. Obtain hands-on experience in processor design, functional verification, and hardware validation, using industry-standard EDA
tools and FPGA devices.
